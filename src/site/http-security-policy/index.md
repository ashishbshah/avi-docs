The following table lists both the available HTTP security match criteria and the configurable actions that can occur when a match is made.  
**Match** **Client IP:** Client IP address or a group of client addresses.

* Use a "**-**" to specify a range: 10.0.0.0-10.1.255.255
* Use a "**/**" to specify a netmask: 10.0.0.0/24 **Service Port:** The ports the virtual service is listening on. **Protocol Type:** HTTP or HTTPS. Example: **https:**//www.avinetworks.com/marketing/index.html?a=1&b=2 **HTTP Method:** The method used by the client request. The match is true if any one of the methods that an administrator specifies is true. **HTTP Version:** True if the client version is .9, 1.0, or 1.1 **Path:** The path or a group of paths. Paths do not need to begin with a ‘/’. For comparison purposes, Vantage automatically omits any initial slash specified in the match field. Example: https://www.avinetworks.com/**marketing/index.html**?a=1&b=2 **Query:** A query or a group of queries. Do not add the leading ‘?’ or ‘&’ characters to a match. Example: https://www.avinetworks.com/marketing/index.html?**a=1&b=2** **Headers:** True if a header exists, or if it exists and contains a specified value **Cookie:** True if a cookie exists, or if it exists and contains a specified value **Host Header:** The request’s host header. Example: https://**www.avinetworks.com**/marketing/index.html?a=1&b=2 **Actions** **Logging:** Selecting the logging checkbox causes Vantage to log when an action has been invoked. **Action Allow:** Allows matched requests to continue on to further policies or to the destination pool servers. **Action Close Conn:** Matched requests will cause Vantage to close the TCP connection that received the request via a FIN. Many browsers open multiple connections, which are not closed unless requests sent over those connections also trigger a close connection action. **Redirect To HTTPS:** Respond to the request with a temporary redirect to the desired port for SSL. **Action Send Response:** Vantage may serve an HTTP response using HTTP status code 200 (success), 403 (unauthorized), or 404 (file not found). A default page is rendered by the browser for each of these status codes, or you may upload a custom .html file. This file may have links to images or other files, but only the initial html file will be stored and served via the Send Response.
