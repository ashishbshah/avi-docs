Avi Vantage relies on Templates and Profiles to group together collections of settings into a single, reusable object. A profile may be used by multiple objects such as Virtual Services referencing the same TCP Profile. By making a change to the TCP Profile, all associated Virtual Services will inherit the change.

Avi Vantage supports the following Templates and Profiles:

*   [Application Profile][1]

*   [TCP/UDP Profile][2]

*   [Persistence Profile][3]

*   [Health Monitor Profile][4]

*   [Analytics Profile][5]

 [1]: ./application-profile
 [2]: ./tcpudp-profile
 [3]: ./persistence-profile
 [4]: ./health-monitor-profile
 [5]: ./analytics-profile
