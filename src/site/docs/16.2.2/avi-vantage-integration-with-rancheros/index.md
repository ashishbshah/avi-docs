title: Avi Vantage Integration with Rancher OS

Avi Vantage supports integration with Rancher OS. This article describes how to create a cloud configuration for Rancher OS, and how to create application stacks and services (in Vantage terminology, "virtual services").

## Requirements

Integration of Avi Vantage with Rancher OS has the following prerequisites:

* The Rancher cluster must already be set up, with CentOS/CoreOS Virtual Machines (VMs) or Linux server (bare metal) hosts.
* Rancher (Server/Agent): v1.0.0
* Cattle: v0.159.2
* All Rancher hosts within the cloud must have a sudo-enabled SSH user account. As part of integration, an SSH account with the same name will need to be created on the Avi Controller.
Note: Vantage works only with OSs that have systemctl support. Currently, this applies to CoreOS and to CentOS 7.0 and higher.
* The Avi Controller must already be installed and running as a container (see example below) on one of the Rancher nodes, or it can run as a container on separate VM/host.

* The Avi Controller must be configured with a link-local subnet, to use for allocating IP addresses for east-west applications. In this article, we will use subnet of 169.254.0.0/24. To create a link-local subnet using the Vantage CLI, log onto the Avi Controller through SSH or the CLI shell, and use the following commands: <pre class="command-line language-bash" data-prompt=": >" data-output="2-5"><code>: &gt; configure serviceengineproperties
seproperties&gt; se_runtime_properties
seproperties:se_runtime_properties&gt; service_ip_subnets 169.254.0.0/24
seproperties:se_runtime_properties&gt; save
seproperties&gt; save
: &gt;</code></pre>

## Creating the Rancher OS Cloud

To create the cloud configuration for Rancher OS, log onto the Avi Controller web interface and use the following steps:

1. Navigate to Infrastructure > Clouds.
1. Click Create, enter a name for the cloud, select Rancher as the infrastructure type, and click Next.

1. Enter Rancher access settings:

* Access credentials (access key, secret key)
* Rancher endpoints (server IP addresses or URLs)

* Click Next, and select or create the SSH user account the Avi Controller will use to log onto hosts within the cloud. A sudo-enabled SSH account with the same name must exist on each of the hosts within the RancherOS cloud.

1. Click SSH User.
1. Enter the username (sudo-enabled user for all Rancher nodes).
1. Select the Import Private Key radio button, and either Copy-Paste the private key or Click Load Private Key From File and Upload the key.
1. Click Save. The SSH user appears in the list.
1. Click Next. If IPAM configuration is desired, it can be configured at this point. (More information to appear in an updated version of this article.) Click Complete.

The Avi Controller now will connect to every Rancher node in the cluster using the SSH key configuration and bring up Avi SEs on all of them.

## Creating Virtual Services

A sample rancher-compose.ymlÂ below configures 1 north-south application (6 containers) and 1 east-west application (2 containers). In this example, the east-west application is given IP address 169.254.0.10.
<pre><code class="language-lua">east-west-app:
  image: avinetworks/node-app-nsew
  labels:
    com.avinetworks.avi_proxy: '{"virtualservice": {"east_west_placement": true, "ip_address": {"type": "V4", "addr": "169.254.0.10"}, "analytics_policy": {"client_insights": "NO_INSIGHTS", "metrics_realtime_update": {"duration": 0, "enabled": true}, "full_client_logs": {"duration": 0, "enabled": true}}}, "pool": {"lb_algorithm": "LB_ALGORITHM_ROUND_ROBIN"}}'
  ports:
  - '8080'
  scale: 2
north-south-app:
  image: avinetworks/node-app-nsew
  labels:
    com.avinetworks.avi_proxy: '{"virtualservice": {"ip_address": {"type": "V4", "addr": "10.144.131.197"}, "analytics_policy": {"client_insights": "NO_INSIGHTS", "metrics_realtime_update": {"duration": 0, "enabled": true}, "full_client_logs": {"duration": 0, "enabled": true}}}, "pool": {"lb_algorithm": "LB_ALGORITHM_ROUND_ROBIN"}}'
  ports:
  - '8080'
  scale: 6</code></pre>

On the Avi Controller, the applications show up as virtual services. (In the web interface, navigate to the Applications > Dashboard.)
