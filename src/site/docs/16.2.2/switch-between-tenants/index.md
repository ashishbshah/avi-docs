title: Switch Between Tenants
layout: default

User accounts that have access to multiple tenants are placed into a single, default tenant after login. To switch the management session to another tenant:

1. In the web interface, click on your username in the upper right corner of the display, and select Tenant View.
<a href="img/tenant-switch1.png"><img src="img/tenant-switch1.png" alt="tenant-switch1" width="1060" height="160"></a>
1. Select the tenant and click Done.
<a href="img/tenant-switch2.png"><img src="img/tenant-switch2.png" alt="tenant-switch2" width="450" height="306"></a>

Now the resources that can be accessed in the web interface are those that belong to the newly selected tenant, instead of the previously selected tenant.

Note: If you are logged in with a super user account, a read-only <a href="/docs/latest/all-tenants-view">All Tenants</a> tenant also is available.
