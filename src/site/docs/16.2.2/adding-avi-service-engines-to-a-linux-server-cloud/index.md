title: Adding Avi Service Engines to a Linux Server Cloud
layout: default

This article describes how to add a new Avi Service Engine (SE) to an existing Linux server cloud.

The article assumes the following:

* The Avi Controller is already installed.
* The Linux server cloud configuration already exists on the Avi Controller.

### To Add Servers to a Linux Server Cloud

1. Navigate to Infrastructure > Clouds.
1. Click on <img src="img/edit-icon-2.png" alt="edit-icon" width="13" height="12"> (edit icon) to open the configuration pages for the cloud. The cloud name is "Default-Cloud," unless another cloud has already been configured.

1. Click Linux Server Configuration, if the tab is not already displayed.

1. The SSH User field shows the SSH user name the Avi Controller will use to log onto each of the Avi SE hosts. <a href="/public-key-management-on-service-engine-host/">A key generated by the Avi Controller for that SSH user account is required, and must be present in the authorized keys store of each Avi SE host.</a>
1. For each Linux server that will host an Avi SE, enter or select the following information:

* Host IP address: must already be configured on the host
* DPDK: Yes if installing directly onto bare metal with an applicable Ethernet NIC; No if installing onto a virtual machine (VM) or a NIC not supported for DPDK
* Number of Cores (CPUs)
* Memory

* Click Complete.

## Verifying Avi SE Creation

1. In the Avi Controller web interface, navigate to Infrastructure > Clouds.
1. Click on the row for "Default-Cloud". (This is the name of the cloud created by the setup wizard.) Information for each of the Avi SE hosts in the cloud is displayed.

<img src="img/linux-cloud-seinstall-status-1.png" alt="linux-cloud-seinstall-status" width="940" height="412">
This example shows a cloud containing a single Avi SE host. (Your cloud may contain more, of course!)

Click on the row for the cloud to toggle display of the Avi SE information.

The state information for the host in this example is "SSH Failed". This may be the most common issue encountered during Linux server cloud installation. It indicates that the Avi Controller tried to log into the Avi SE host with the SSH user account and corresponding key specified during setup, but could not successfully negotiate the handshake.

If the Avi Controller is able to log onto the Avi SE host, the following messages should appear:

Image in Progress
Image Complete
Start in Progress
Started
In Progress

and finally,

Placement Ready

After the Placement Ready status appears for the Avi SE, virtual services can be <a href="/docs/configuration-guide/applications/virtual-services/create-virtual-service/">created</a> and placed on it.
